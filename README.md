# flifPress
Working with Dr. Andrew Cohen on his flifPress project. You can view his git at: https://git-bioimage.coe.drexel.edu/opensource/ncd

## Set Up
Set up your virtual environment by using virtualenv
In your virtual env, install the requirements with
##### pip install -r requirements.txt
Once the necessary libaries are set up, you should be able to run functions from gnist.py and NCD.py.
Note, if you're running from the command line, you will not be able to see the images (I suggest running from jupyter). However, the calculations will still work
